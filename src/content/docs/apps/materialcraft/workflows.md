On a Mac, use **⌘** in place of **Ctrl** in the shortcuts below.

## The panels

| Panel | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| **Explorer** | The open package and its graphs. Click a graph to open it |
| **Library** | Every node you can add. Search it, or drag a node onto the graph |
| **Graph** | Where you build the material |
| **Properties** | The settings of the selected node, or of the graph |
| **2D View** | One node's result as a flat image |
| **3D View** | The whole material on a shape or a model |
| **Console** | Messages, warnings and errors |
| **History** | Your recent changes |

Open or close panels from the **Windows** menu. **Windows › Reset layout** puts them back where they started.

## Packages and graphs

A package is one .sbs file. It can hold several graphs, plus the images they use.

- **File › New › Graph...** adds a graph to the open package.
- **File › New › Function Graph...** adds a function graph: a graph of maths operations, saved in the package.
- **File › New › Empty package** starts again with an empty package.
- **File › Open...** opens an .sbs package, or a .mcmat material.

## Build the graph

- Point at the graph and press **Space** or **Tab** to search for a node. Right-click the graph for **Add node** and more.
- Drag from an output port to an input port to connect two nodes.
- Double-click a node to show it in the **2D View**.
- Select nodes and choose **Tools › Create graph from selection** to turn them into a graph of their own.
- Right-click the graph to add a comment, a frame, or a navigation pin. **F2** and **Shift+F2** jump between pins.
- **Tools › Snap to grid** turns snapping on or off.

| To | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Zoom | Scroll the wheel |
| Pan | Middle-drag, or **Alt**+drag |
| Frame everything, or the selection | **F** |
| Duplicate | **Ctrl+D** |
| Delete | **Delete** |
| Delete a node and join its wires back up | **Backspace** |
| Turn the selected nodes off | **Shift+D** |
| Undo, redo | **Ctrl+Z**, **Ctrl+Y** |

### Edit wires

- Click a wire to select it. **Shift**+click or **Ctrl**+click selects more.
- Press **Delete** to remove the selected wires.
- Select two or more wires into a node and press **X** to swap where they come from. On a **Blend** node, this swaps the foreground and background.
- Drag a wire to pull a reroute dot out of it. Double-click a wire to drop a dot there.
- Right-click a wire for **Insert reroute dot** and the other wire commands.

## Use graph inputs and outputs

- **Output** nodes are what the graph makes. Give each a usage, such as base colour, normal or roughness. The 3D View and the export use them.
- **Input Color**, **Input Grayscale** and **Input Value** nodes are inputs of the graph. Use them to feed in an image or a value from outside.

## Write a function

**Pixel Processor** computes every pixel of its image with a function. **Value Processor** computes one value with a function.

Select the node, then choose **Edit function graph...** in **Properties**. In the function editor you add operations, set constants, wire them up and pick the result.

## Make a pattern with an FX-Map

An **FX-Map** node builds an image by placing and repeating shapes.

1. Select the FX-Map node and press **Ctrl+E** (**Edit › Edit node graph**), or right-click it and choose **Edit graph**.
2. Inside, add **Quadrant**, **Switch**, **Iterate** and **Dot** nodes. Wire them from bottom ports to top ports.
3. Right-click a node and choose **Set as root** to make it the start of the pattern.
4. Press **Alt+Left** (**Edit › Parent graph**) to go back to the main graph.

## Adjust levels

Select a **Levels** node. **Properties** shows a histogram of the node's input, with the levels curve over it. Drag the handles under the histogram to set the input range and midtones, and the handles under the grey bar to set the output range. The sliders below give exact values.

## Use images

Choose **File › Import bitmap...** to add an image to the package. MaterialCraft reads SVG, PNG, JPEG, TGA, TIFF, BMP, WebP, OpenEXR and Radiance HDR. Use it in the graph with a **Bitmap** or **SVG** node. **File › Reload resources** reads the files again after you change them.

## Preview your material

In the **2D View**, show one channel (R, G, B or A) or all of them, turn on a histogram, or tile the image three by three to check its edges. **Save image...** saves what you see as PNG, OpenEXR or TGA.

The **3D View** has its own menus:

- **Scene**: pick a shape, load your own OBJ, glTF or GLB model with **Load mesh...**, or **Reset scene**.
- **Camera**, **Environment**, **Display** and **Renderer**: the view, the lighting, and options such as tiling, height depth, transparency and **Flip normal map Y (DirectX)**.

**Shift**+drag in the 3D View turns the lighting. **Tools › View outputs in 3D view** puts the graph's outputs on the 3D model.

While you edit, previews are computed at a smaller size to stay fast. Change it in **Tools › Preview size**.

## Export

- **File › Export outputs...** (**Ctrl+Shift+E**) writes every output of the graph as an image. Pick the **Folder**, **Format**, **Bit depth**, **Resolution** (up to 8192 pixels) and the **File names** pattern.
- **File › Export material...** writes a portable .mcmat file with the maps and the graph together.

## Preferences

Choose **Edit › Preferences...** to set the language (English or Arabic), brightness, accent colour, interface scale, how often to autosave, the preview size while editing, node thumbnails, and how the 3D view pans.

**Help › Shortcuts list...** lists every shortcut.

## Use it with an AI assistant

MaterialCraft's command-line tool, `materialcraft-cli`, has an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so Claude and other AI assistants can build graphs, set parameters and export maps. Give it the folders it may read and write:

```bash
claude mcp add materialcraft -- materialcraft-cli mcp --read-root . --write-root .
```

To see its changes live, start the app with `materialcraft --control 7878`, then connect with `materialcraft-cli mcp --bridge 7878`.

The tool also works on its own. Run `materialcraft-cli --help` to see what it can do, for example:

```bash
materialcraft-cli new pbr my-material.sbs --size 2048
materialcraft-cli export my-material.sbs textures --format png --depth 16
materialcraft-cli render my-material.sbs preview.png --scene sphere
```
