TextureCraft has three modes, on the **Mode** menu and at the right of the top bar:

- **Painting** (**F9**): layers, masks and the painting tools.
- **Bake Mesh Maps** (**F8**): make the mesh maps that smart materials and generators use.
- **Rendering (path traced)** (**F10**): a realistic preview of your textures.

On a Mac, use **⌘** in place of **Ctrl** in the shortcuts below.

## Work with texture sets

Each material in your model is a texture set, listed in the **Texture Sets** panel. Click one to paint on it. The eye icon shows or hides it.

Open **Texture Set Settings** (next to **Layers**) to change the texture size of a set, from 256 to 8192 pixels, or to add and remove channels. This is also where you set the **Normal map format** (OpenGL or DirectX) for the project.

## Build up layers

The **Layers** panel works like the layer stack in an image editor, but every layer holds all the material channels at once: base colour, roughness, metallic, height, normal and more.

- **Add paint layer** for brush strokes, **Add fill layer** for a material that covers the whole texture set, or add a folder to group layers.
- Each layer has a blend mode and an opacity for each channel. Use the menu at the top of the panel to pick the channel.
- **Ctrl+D** duplicates the selected layers, **Ctrl+G** groups them, and **Delete** removes them. **Ctrl+C** and **Ctrl+V** copy and paste layers, also to another texture set.
- Right-click a layer for more, including **Flatten layer**.

A fill layer's **Properties** set its material and how it is projected: UV, tri-planar, planar, spherical, cylindrical or decal. Each channel can take its own image, such as a normal or roughness map.

### Save your own smart material

Right-click a layer or folder and choose **Create smart material**. It appears in the **Smart materials** tab of the **Assets** shelf, under **My smart materials**, ready to drag onto other models.

## Use masks

A mask shows a layer in some places and hides it in others.

1. Select a layer and choose **Add mask**. Pick a white mask (shows everything) or a black mask (hides everything).
2. Add effects to the mask: paint on it, or add a generator such as edge wear or dirt, which uses the baked mesh maps. Filters, fills and levels work on masks too.
3. **Alt**+click a mask to see it on its own in the viewport.

Drag an effect to change its order in the stack. Right-click it to duplicate it or copy it to another layer.

The **Smart masks** tab of the shelf has ready-made masks. Drag one onto a layer.

### Quick mask

A quick mask protects part of the model while you paint. Press **Y** to turn it on, **U** to paint the mask itself (press **U** again to finish), and **Ctrl+Shift+I** to invert it.

## Painting tools

| Tool | Key | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paint | **1** | **Shift**+click draws a straight line from the last stroke |
| Eraser | **2** | |
| Projection | **3** | Paints through an image stencil. Hold **S** and drag to move, turn or scale the stencil |
| Polygon fill | **4** | Fills a triangle, a UV island or the whole mesh |
| Smudge | **5** | |
| Clone | **6** | Hold **V** and click to set the source |
| Path | **7** | Draw a path, then press **Enter** to paint along it, or fill it once it is closed |
| Geometry mask | **8** | Click mesh parts to show or hide the selected layer on them |
| Colour picker | **P** | |

Brush settings (size, flow, stroke opacity, spacing) are in the bar at the top. **Shift** and the mouse wheel change the brush size over the model. The bar also has symmetry and lazy mouse.

Pen pressure works with Windows Ink pens, and with touch pens in the browser. On macOS and Linux, a pen works as a mouse for now.

The **Brushes** and **Alphas** tabs of the shelf have brush presets and brush shapes. Save your own brush there with **Save current brush**.

## Change the view

| To | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Show the 3D and 2D views side by side | **F1** |
| Show the 3D view only | **F2** |
| Show the 2D view only | **F3** |
| Show the full material | **M** |
| Show the next channel | **C** (**Shift+C** for the previous one) |
| Show the next mesh map | **B** (**Shift+B** for the previous one) |
| Fit the model in the view | **F** |
| Hide the panels | **Tab** |

**Viewport › UV checker** shows a checker pattern, to spot stretched UVs.

To keep a camera angle, open the camera menu at the top of the 3D view and choose **Save view as camera**. **Ctrl+1** to **Ctrl+9** jump to the first nine saved cameras.

## Bake mesh maps

Choose **Mode › Bake Mesh Maps** (**F8**). Tick the texture sets on the left, then tick the maps you want under **Mesh Map Bakers**: normal, world space normal, ID, ambient occlusion, curvature, position, thickness, height, bent normals, opacity, colour map and world space direction. Click a baker to see its settings.

To bake detail from a high-poly model, choose **Add High-Poly Meshes** in the common parameters. Choose **Bake Selected Textures** to start, and **Return to Painting Mode** when it's done.

Baking uses your graphics card when it can, and your processor otherwise. You can also use mesh maps you baked in another app: drop the image from the **Assets** panel onto a slot in **Texture Set Settings**.

## Export textures

Choose **File › Export Textures...** (**Ctrl+Shift+E**).

![The Export textures window on its Settings tab: the texture sets ticked on the left, and the output directory, output template, file type, size, padding and normal map format on the right](/assets/uploads/texturecraft/export.webp)

- **Settings**: pick the texture sets, the **Output directory**, the **Output template**, the **File type**, the **Size**, the **Padding** and the **Normal map format**.
- **Output templates**: the built-in presets, and your own. A template says which channels go into which image, so you can pack, for example, roughness, metallic and ambient occlusion into one file.
- **List of exports**: the files that will be written.

The built-in presets include **Unreal Engine (Packed)**, **Unity HDRP (Mask Map)**, **Unity Standard (Metallic Smoothness)**, **Godot 4 (ORM)**, **Blender (Principled BSDF)** and **OpenPBR (separate maps)**.

To export the model itself with its textures, choose **File › Export Mesh...**. It writes OBJ (with an MTL file), GLB or USD.

## Render a preview

Choose **Mode › Rendering (path traced)** (**F10**). TextureCraft traces light through the scene, so the image gets cleaner the longer you wait.

![Rendering mode: the portable TV path traced at 256 samples with a denoiser, and the render settings in a card over the viewport](/assets/uploads/texturecraft/rendering.webp)

Set **Samples** and **Bounces**, tick **Denoise** for a cleaner image, or tick **Render on the CPU** if your graphics card can't do it. **Save render...** saves the image as PNG. **Back to painting** returns to Painting mode.

## Bring in a changed model

If you change the model in your 3D app, choose **Edit › Reimport mesh** (**Ctrl+Shift+R**). Your painted strokes stay on the surface.

## Settings

Choose **Edit › Settings...**:

- **Interface**: language, interface scale, brightness (four levels from dark to light), accent colour, the title bar and the start window.
- **Viewport**: the texture resolution of the viewport.
- **Project**: how often to autosave.
- **Folders**: the data folder for autosaves, smart materials, presets, templates and UI layouts. It's `Documents/TextureCraft` by default.
- **Keyboard**: **Edit keyboard shortcuts...** to change any shortcut.

The interface is in English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Arabic.

**Window › Save UI Layout › Save current layout...** and **Window › Load UI Layout** keep your panel layout. **Window › Reset UI** puts everything back.

## Keyboard shortcuts

**Help › Shortcuts list...** shows them all. The most used:

| Shortcut | What it does |
