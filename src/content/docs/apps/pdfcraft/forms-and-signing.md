## Fill in a form

When a PDF has form fields, a bar above the page says how many it has. Click **Highlight fields** to see where they are. Click a field and type, select the boxes, or pick from the lists.

The **Fields** panel on the right lists every field and what's in it. **Edit › Clear form** empties them all.

## Fill and sign a form that has no fields

Many forms are just printed pages, with nowhere to type. Choose **Fill & Sign** in the tools panel, or the **E-Sign** tab at the top, then:

- **Add text** types wherever you click.
- **Checkmark**, **Cross**, **Dot** and **Line** mark boxes and lines.
- **Date** adds today's date. **Edit › Preferences…** sets its format.
- **Signature** and **Initials** add your signature or initials.

The first time you add a signature, PdfCraft asks you to make one. **Type** your name, **Draw** it with the mouse or a pen, use an **Image** of it (a PNG or JPEG), or **Scan** it. PdfCraft remembers it for next time. **Sign › Fill & Sign** has the same tools, and the commands to change or remove your saved signature and initials.

## Sign with a digital ID

A digital signature proves who signed and shows whether the document has changed since. Choose **Use a certificate** in the tools panel:

- **Digitally sign** asks you to choose the digital ID to sign with. If you don't have one, you can use a digital ID from a file, or create a new one. A new ID is self-signed and saved to a file protected by a password.
- **Certify (visible signature)** and **Certify (invisible signature)** sign as the author and set what others can still do: nothing, fill in the form and sign, or also add comments.
- **Validate all signatures** checks every signature in the document. The **Signatures** panel shows the results.

:::note
A self-signed ID shows that the document hasn't changed since you signed it. It doesn't prove who you are to others the way an ID from a certificate authority does.

## Make a form

Choose **Prepare a form**:

- **Detect form fields** adds fields to a form that doesn't have any.
- Add fields yourself: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down lists, list boxes, buttons, date fields, image fields and digital signature fields.
- **Field properties** sets a field's options, such as its appearance and actions. **Calculation order** and the **Tab order** commands set how fields work together.
- **Flatten form fields** makes the filled-in values part of the page, so the form can't be changed any more.

## Move form data in and out

**Prepare a form** also has **Import data** and **Export data**, to fill a form from a data file or save what's in it. **Merge data files into spreadsheet…** (find it with **Ctrl+K**) gathers the answers from many filled-in copies of the same form.
