PdfCraft groups its tools in the **All tools** panel on the left: **Export a PDF**, **Fill & Sign**, **Edit a PDF**, **Create a PDF**, **Combine files**, **Organize pages**, **Add comments**, **Scan & OCR**, **Protect a PDF**, **Redact a PDF**, **Compress a PDF**, **Prepare a form** and more under **View more**. Pick one and its tools appear above the page. The same commands are in the menus under **Menu**. If you can't find a command, press **Ctrl+K** (**⌘K** on a Mac) and type its name.

## Read

- **View › Page display** switches between **Single page** and **Two-page view**, and turns **Continuous scrolling** on or off.
- **View › Zoom** has **Actual size** (**Ctrl+1**), **Fit to width** (**Ctrl+2**), **Zoom to page level** (**Ctrl+0**) and more. **Ctrl++** and **Ctrl+−** zoom in and out.
- **View › Full screen mode** (**Ctrl+L**) fills the screen with the page. **Read mode** hides the tools.
- **F4** shows or hides the side panel, and **Shift+F4** the tools panel. **View › Side panels** opens **Comments**, **Bookmarks**, **Pages**, **Fields**, **Layers**, **Attachments** or **Signatures**.
- **View › Display theme** chooses light, dark, or your system's setting. The moon button at the top right switches too.

## Find text

**Ctrl+F** finds text in the document. **Ctrl+G** and **Ctrl+Shift+G** go to the next and previous match. **Edit › Advanced search…** (**Ctrl+Shift+F**) has more options.

## Comment

Choose **Add comments** to add a **Sticky note**, highlight, underline, strike through or squiggly-underline text, add a **Text box**, draw freehand, or draw a rectangle, oval, line or arrow. Every comment is listed in the **Comments** panel, by page. Click one to go to it, or reply to it there.

**Add a stamp** puts a stamp on the page from the stamp palette. **Flatten comments** makes comments part of the page, so they can no longer be changed.

## Edit

Choose **Edit a PDF**:

- **Edit text & images** changes text and pictures already on the page. This works best on simple pages. It's still weak on complex layouts and on right-to-left and Chinese, Japanese or Korean text.
- **Text** and **Image** add new text and pictures.
- **Header and footer**, **Watermark** and **Background** add, update or remove them on every page.
- **Link** adds or edits links. **Bates numbering** numbers the pages for legal work. **Attach file** attaches a file to the PDF.

## Protect and redact

- **Protect a PDF › Protect with password** sets a password to open the document, or one to change it, and chooses what people can do: print, change pages, copy text and so on. The password is applied when you save.
- **Remove hidden information** lists things in the file you can't see on the page, such as metadata, so you can pick what to remove.
- **Redact a PDF** blacks out text, pictures or whole pages. Mark what to remove with **Redact text and images**, or use **Find text and redact** to mark every match, then choose **Apply redactions**. **Sanitize document** removes everything hidden: metadata, attachments, comments, hidden text and layers, bookmarks, links and scripts. Form fields are flattened, so their values stay visible. Save afterwards: saving rewrites the whole file, so nothing removed stays in it.

:::caution
Applied redactions remove the text, pictures and drawings under the marks for good, along with comments and form fields that overlap them. Redaction can't find text inside pictures: recognise the text with OCR first. Keep a copy of the original.

## Convert

- **File › Export** saves the PDF as **Word**, **PowerPoint**, **RTF**, **HTML**, plain text, or each page as a picture. **Export all images…** saves every picture in the document. The layout of Word exports isn't kept well yet.
- **File › Create** makes a PDF from another file, several files, pictures or the clipboard, or a **New blank PDF**.
- **Compress a PDF › Reduce file size** makes a smaller copy. **Advanced optimization** chooses what to shrink.

## Recognise scanned text

A scanned page is a picture of words, so you can't search or copy it. Choose **Scan & OCR › In this file** to recognise the text, or **In multiple files** for several PDFs at once. Pick the language, the pages and whether to straighten or clean up the pages, then press **Run OCR**.

PdfCraft shows the words it found, coloured by how sure it is. Go through the uncertain ones with **Next uncertain** (**F8**), click a word to correct it, then press **Accept** to add the text to the PDF, or **Reject** to leave it out. OCR works best on Latin-script languages.

## More tools

**View more** in the tools panel also has **Measure objects** (distance, perimeter and area), **Compare files**, **Use guided actions** (the **Action Wizard**), **Prepare for accessibility** (with **Check for accessibility** and tagging tools), and **Apply PDF standards › Save as PDF/A** for archiving.

## Print

1. Choose **File › Print…** (**Ctrl+P**).
2. Pick a **Printer**, or **Save as PDF** to get a print-ready file instead.
3. Choose the pages and how they fit on the paper (see below). The preview on the right shows each sheet.
4. Press **Print**.

If a document's security settings don't allow printing, PdfCraft won't print it. See [I can't print this document](/apps/pdfcraft/troubleshooting/#i-cant-print-this-document).

### Printer and paper

- **Copies** goes up to 999. **Collate** keeps each copy in order, and **Print in grayscale** drops the color.
- **Two-sided** can flip on the long or short edge.
- **Paper** includes US Letter, Legal, Tabloid, A0 to A6, ARCH and ANSI sizes, a 4 x 6 in label and a #10 envelope. PdfCraft remembers your last choice.
- **Match page at 100%** picks the standard paper that fits the page and prints it at full size.
- **Properties…** opens the printer's own settings, such as the paper tray.

### Pages

Print **All** pages, the **Current page**, or a range under **Pages**, such as `1-5`. If you selected pages before opening Print, **Selected pages** is offered too. **More options** can limit the print to odd or even pages, or print in reverse order.

### Fit pages on paper

| Tab | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Size** | **Fit** the page to the paper, print at **Actual size**, shrink only pages that are too big, or set a **Custom scale**. |
| **Poster** | Prints one page across several sheets, with an overlap and cut marks, so you can tape them together. |
| **Multiple** | Puts 2, 4, 6, 9 or 16 pages on one sheet. **Cut and stack** orders them so you can cut the sheets and stack the piles in page order. |
| **Booklet** | Prints sheets that fold into a booklet, bound on the left or right. |
| **Label** | Fits each page onto one label, such as a 4 x 6 in shipping label. |

**Orientation** can be portrait, landscape or automatic.

For scale drawings, use **Actual size**. **Fit** leaves a small margin, so it prints slightly smaller than 100%.

### Comments, forms and other options

- **Comments & Forms** chooses whether to print the document alone, with markups or stamps, or only the form fields.
- **Advanced › Print as image** sends each page as a picture, at 150, 300 or 600 dpi. Try it when a printer leaves out text, shading or transparency.

In the web version, **Printer** offers your browser's print dialog instead of a list of printers.

## Preferences

Choose **Edit › Preferences…** (**Ctrl+,**). Among other things, you can change the **Interface language**, the **Interface size**, which side the tools panel and side panels are on, the **Default page display**, whether PdfCraft reopens the files you had open last time, and whether it checks for updates when it starts.

## Keyboard shortcuts

On a Mac, use **⌘** in place of **Ctrl**. **Help › Keyboard shortcuts** lists them all.

| Shortcut | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Ctrl+O** | Open |
| **Ctrl+S**, **Ctrl+Shift+S** | Save, save as |
| **Ctrl+W** | Close the file |
| **Ctrl+P** | Print |

| **Ctrl+K** | Find tools and commands |
| **Ctrl+Shift+N** | Go to page |
| **Ctrl+1**, **Ctrl+2**, **Ctrl+0** | Actual size, fit to width, whole page |

| **Ctrl+B** | New bookmark |
| **Ctrl+L** | Full screen |
