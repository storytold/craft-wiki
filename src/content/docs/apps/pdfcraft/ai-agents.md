AI assistants that support the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) can use PdfCraft's tools: open PDFs, read their text, add comments, fill forms, organize pages and save the result. This is off unless you set it up. PdfCraft never starts it on its own, and it opens no network port.

## Get the command-line tool

Assistants talk to PdfCraft through its command-line tool, `pdfcraft-cli`:

- **Windows**: `pdfcraft-cli.exe` is next to `pdfcraft.exe` in the install folder or portable zip.
- **macOS**: download `pdfcraft-cli-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` from the [release page](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/releases/latest).
- **Linux `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.pkg.tar.zst`, tarball, and FreeBSD**: it's installed alongside the app. On Linux, `pdfcraft-cli-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` (or `aarch64`) has the command-line tool on its own, for servers.
- **Flatpak**: run it as `flatpak run --command=pdfcraft-cli ai.storyteller.pdfcraft`.
- **AppImage**: use the tarball instead, which includes it.

If the assistant can't find `pdfcraft-cli`, use its full path, for example `C:\Users\you\AppData\Local\Programs\ArtCraft\PdfCraft\pdfcraft-cli.exe`. Desktop apps often need the full path even when your terminal doesn't.

## Connect your assistant

Every assistant starts PdfCraft's tools with the same command: `pdfcraft-cli mcp`, followed by `--root` and the folder your PDFs are in. The assistant can then only read and write files in that folder. The tools run in the background, with no window, and stop when the assistant disconnects.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add pdfcraft -- pdfcraft-cli mcp --root ~/Documents/pdfs
```

### Claude Desktop

Choose **Settings › Developer › Edit Config**, add PdfCraft to `claude_desktop_config.json`, then restart Claude. Use the full path to the folder, since `~` isn't expanded here:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdfcraft": {
      "command": "pdfcraft-cli",
      "args": ["mcp", "--root", "/Users/you/Documents/pdfs"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other assistants

Look for "MCP servers" in your assistant's settings and add a local (stdio) server with the command `pdfcraft-cli` and the arguments `mcp`, `--root` and your folder.

Add `--compact` after `mcp` to give the assistant a short list of tools to start with. It can still find and use every tool, and the shorter list uses less of its context.

## Ask for something

Once connected, ask in plain words, for example *"Combine the invoices in this folder into one PDF, oldest first"* or *"Highlight every mention of the deadline in contract.pdf and save it"*.

Changes stay in memory, and can be undone, until the assistant saves.

## Keep reading and writing apart

To let the assistant read from one folder but only save into another, use a read folder and a write folder:

```bash
pdfcraft-cli mcp --automation-read-root ~/Documents/pdfs --automation-write-root ~/Documents/pdfs/out
```

The assistant can then only open files inside the read folder, and only save inside the write folder. These limits cover what the assistant does through `pdfcraft-cli`. They don't apply to the PdfCraft app itself.

## From the command line

`pdfcraft-cli` also works on its own, without an assistant:

```bash
pdfcraft-cli info form.pdf                                      # what's in a PDF
pdfcraft-cli text paper.pdf --page 3                            # the text of page 3
pdfcraft-cli edit in.pdf --rotate 1,2:90 --delete 5 --out out.pdf
pdfcraft-cli combine report.pdf appendix.pdf --out combined.pdf
pdfcraft-cli tools                                              # every tool an assistant can use
```

For scripting, run `pdfcraft-cli help`, or see the [developer documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/blob/main/docs/mcp.md).
