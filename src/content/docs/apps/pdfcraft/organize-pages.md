## See every page at once

Choose **Organize pages** in the tools panel. Every page of the document appears as a thumbnail, with the page tools in the panel on the left. **Close** at the top right goes back to the document.

- Click a page to select it. **Ctrl**-click (**⌘**-click on a Mac) adds pages one at a time, and **Shift**-click selects a run of pages.
- Use the panel's **Page options** to rotate the selected pages either way, delete them, insert pages, extract them to a new document, or split the document.

![The Organize pages view: the pages of a 13-page document as thumbnails, three of them selected and outlined in blue, with "3 pages selected" and the page tools in the toolbar above](/assets/uploads/pdfcraft/organize.webp)

The same commands are in **Edit › Pages**, and work on the current page without opening the grid:

- **Insert blank page**, **Insert pages from file…** and **Replace pages…**
- **Duplicate pages**, **Delete pages** and **Reverse pages**
- **Rotate pages clockwise** and **Rotate pages counterclockwise**
- **Crop pages** and **Set page boxes…**
- **Number pages…**, which sets page labels such as i, ii, iii for the front matter

Every change can be undone with **Ctrl+Z** (**⌘Z**), even after you save. Nothing is written to the file until you save.

## Extract pages

**Edit › Pages › Extract pages…** copies the pages you choose into a new document. Tick **Delete pages after extracting** to move them out of the original instead, or **Extract pages as separate files** to make one file per page.

## Split a document

**Edit › Pages › Split document…** divides the document into several files:

- **Number of pages**: set **Pages per file**. With 1, every page becomes its own file.
- **Before each selected page**: select the first page of each part in **Organize pages** first.

The dialog tells you how many files it will make. Press **Split** to make them.

## Combine files

Choose **Combine files** in the tools panel, or **File › Combine files…**, to join several files into one PDF:

1. Drop PDFs, pictures, text files or folders on the window, or click **Add files…**. **Add open documents** adds the PDFs you have open.
2. Drag the files into the order you want. They are combined from top to bottom.
3. In **List view**, type in **Pages** to take only some pages of a file. Leave it empty to take every page.
4. Press **Combine**.

Each file gets a bookmark in the combined PDF, with its own bookmarks under it. Links, form fields, layers and attachments come along too.

## From the command line

`pdfcraft-cli` does the same jobs without opening the app:

```bash
pdfcraft-cli combine report.pdf appendix.pdf --out combined.pdf
pdfcraft-cli extract report.pdf --pages 1,3,5-8 --out highlights.pdf
pdfcraft-cli split report.pdf --every 10 --out-dir parts/
```

See [AI agents](/apps/pdfcraft/ai-agents/#get-the-command-line-tool) for where to find `pdfcraft-cli`.
