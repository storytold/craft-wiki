## Common Issues

### Sketch is over-constrained

- **Symptom**: SolidCraft draws the failing constraints, and the geometry they hold, in the conflict color.
- **Fix**: Check recent dimensions or geometric constraints (like perpendicularity or symmetry). Remove redundant constraints until degrees of freedom match the geometry. Fully defined sketches will turn dark/black without errors.

### Broken timeline features (Yellow or Red in timeline)

- **Symptom**: After editing an earlier sketch or feature, downstream features show yellow (warning) or red (error) icons.
- **Cause**: An edge, face, or vertex referenced by a downstream operation was removed or reshaped during the timeline rebuild.
- **Fix**: Roll back the timeline to the first failing feature, right-click it, and select **Edit Feature**. Re-link the missing target geometry, or project stable datum planes into the sketch.

### Graphics & OpenGL acceleration

- **Symptom**: Black viewport or stuttering navigation in the 3D canvas.
- **Fix**:
  - Ensure your graphics drivers support Vulkan or OpenGL 4.1+.
  - On Linux with Flatpak, ensure your Flatpak runtime matches your host GPU drivers (`flatpak update`).
