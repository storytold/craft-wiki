GridCraft's ribbon groups its tools into tabs: **Home**, **Insert**, **Draw**, **Page Layout**, **Formulas**, **Data**, **Review**, **View** and **Automate**. More tabs, such as **Table Design** and **Chart Design**, appear when you select a table or a chart. If you can't find a command, click the search icon at the top right of the window, or choose **Automate › Command Palette**, and type its name.

## Write formulas

A formula starts with `=`. While you type one, click or drag across cells to add their references.

On the **Formulas** tab:

- **Insert Function** helps you find a function and fill in its arguments. The function library buttons next to it list functions by category.
- **AutoSum** adds a total of the cells next to the selection.
- **Name Manager** and **Define Name** give a cell or range a name you can use in formulas.
- **Trace Precedents** and **Trace Dependents** draw arrows to the cells a formula uses, or that use it. **Evaluate Formula** steps through a formula one part at a time.
- **Show Formulas** shows formulas in the cells instead of their results.
- **Calculation Options** switches between automatic and manual calculation. **Calculate Now** (**F9**) recalculates.

Dynamic-array formulas, such as `=SORT(A2:A20)` or `=UNIQUE(B2:B50)`, spill their results into the cells below and to the right.

:::note[Formulas in Spanish]
If you choose **Español** as the interface language, you type formulas in Spanish too: `=SUMA(A1:A3)`, with a decimal comma and semicolons between arguments. Workbooks are still saved with standard English formulas, so they open the same everywhere. Every other language uses English function names.

## Format cells

On the **Home** tab:

- Font, fill color, borders, alignment, **Wrap Text** and **Merge & Center**.
- Number formats, such as currency, percentage and dates. **Ctrl+1** opens **Format Cells** for every option.
- **Cell Styles** applies a ready-made look, such as a heading or a total.
- **Conditional Formatting** colors cells by their values: **Highlight Cells Rules**, **Top/Bottom Rules**, **Data Bars**, **Color Scales** and **Icon Sets**. **Manage Rules…** lists and edits them.
- **Format Painter** copies formatting from one place to another.

## Work with tables

Select your data and choose **Home › Format as Table**, **Insert › Table**, or press **Ctrl+T**. A table has banded rows and filter buttons on its header row. On the **Table Design** tab you can turn the **Total Row**, **Header Row** and **Banded Rows** on or off, and pick another style.

In a formula, you can refer to a table's columns by name, for example `=SUM(Sales[Q1])`.

## Sort, filter and clean up data

On the **Data** tab:

- **Sort** and **Filter**. **Ctrl+Shift+L** turns filter buttons on or off.
- **Text to Columns** splits one column into several. **Flash Fill** (**Ctrl+E**) fills a column by following an example you type.
- **Remove Duplicates** and **Data Validation**, which limits what can be typed in a cell, for example to a list.
- **Group**, **Ungroup** and **Subtotal** to outline and summarize rows.
- **What-If Analysis**, **Forecast Sheet** and **Solver** for working out numbers.
- **Get Data (Text/CSV)** brings in data from a text file.

## Add charts and sparklines

Select your data, then on the **Insert** tab choose **Recommended Charts**, or one of the chart buttons next to it. **Sparklines** draws a tiny chart inside a cell.

When you select a chart, GridCraft outlines its source data on the sheet and opens the **Chart Design** tab. From there you can add chart elements, switch rows and columns, change the chart type, or open the **Format Pane** to change the title, legend, series and colors.

## Summarize with a pivot table

Click in a table or range, then choose **Insert › PivotTable**. In the **PivotTable Fields** pane, select the fields you want and move them between **Filters**, **Columns**, **Rows** and **Values**. Press **Refresh** after the source data changes. **Report Layout** changes how the table is laid out.

## Add pictures, shapes and comments

On the **Insert** tab:

- **Pictures** › **Place over Cells** floats a PNG or JPEG over the sheet. **Place in Cell** puts it inside the active cell, where it stays with the cell when you sort, filter or resize rows and columns.
- **Shapes**, **Icons**, **Text Box** and **Symbol**.
- **Link** adds a hyperlink (**Ctrl+K**).
- **Comment** starts a comment thread on a cell.

On the **Review** tab you can add notes, go through comments, check spelling (**F7**), run the accessibility checker, and protect a sheet or the workbook's structure with an optional password.

## Print and export

On the **Page Layout** tab, set **Margins**, orientation, paper **Size**, the **Print Area**, page **Breaks** and **Print Titles** (rows or columns that repeat on every page).

**View › Page Break Preview** shows where each page starts and ends.

![The Household Budget in Page Break Preview: the print area is outlined in blue, a dashed line splits it into Page 1 and Page 2, and the area outside it is grayed out](/assets/uploads/gridcraft/page-break.webp)

To print, choose **File › Print** and pick a printer. **Page Setup…** there has every page option, and **Fit Sheet on One Page** shrinks the sheet to fit. After that, **Ctrl+P** prints straight to the printer you chose.

**File › Export** makes a PDF of the sheet, or saves the active sheet as a CSV file or the workbook as a web page. These are copies: your workbook keeps its own .xlsx file.

## Record and run macros

A macro records a sequence of steps and plays them back, so you can repeat a task in one go. On the **Automate** tab:

1. Select the cells to work on, then choose **Record Macro**. Give the macro a name and, if you like, a **Ctrl+Shift** shortcut letter.
2. Do the steps you want to repeat.
3. Choose **Stop Recording**.

With **Use Relative References** on (the default), the macro works on whatever cells you select when you run it, not only the cells you recorded it on.

**Run Macro** runs the last macro you used, and its menu lists them all. **Macros** opens a list where you can run, edit, step through or delete each one. **New Macro** lets you write one step by step.

A macro runs as a single step, so one **Ctrl+Z** undoes all of it. If a step fails, GridCraft puts the workbook back as it was. Before a macro writes over cells that already hold data, it asks whether to overwrite them or shift them down or right.

:::caution
GridCraft's macros are its own kind, not VBA. A workbook from Excel keeps its VBA macros when you save it as .xlsm, but GridCraft doesn't run them. Macros that came with a workbook you opened ask before they run.

## Change how GridCraft looks

On the **View** tab:

- **Normal**, **Page Break Preview** and **Page Layout** views.
- Show or hide the **Formula Bar**, **Gridlines** and **Headings**.
- **Zoom**, **100%** and **Zoom to Selection**.
- **Freeze Panes** keeps header rows or columns in view as you scroll.
- **New Window** and **Arrange All** to see two parts of a workbook at once.
- **Display theme**: **System**, **Light** or **Dark**.
- **Interface size** makes the whole window bigger or smaller.
- **Interface language**. By default, GridCraft follows your system's language.

More settings, such as AutoComplete and AutoSave, are in **File › Options**.

## Keyboard shortcuts

GridCraft uses the shortcuts you'd expect from a spreadsheet app. On a Mac, use **⌘** in place of **Ctrl** for most of them.

| Shortcut | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Ctrl+N**, **Ctrl+O**, **Ctrl+S** | New, open, save |
| **Ctrl+Shift+S** or **F12** | Save As |
| **Ctrl+B**, **Ctrl+I**, **Ctrl+U** | Bold, italic, underline |
| **Ctrl+Z** | Undo |
| **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z** | Redo |
| **Ctrl+C**, **Ctrl+X**, **Ctrl+V** | Copy, cut, paste |
| **Ctrl+F**, **Ctrl+H** | Find, replace |
| **Ctrl+G** or **F5** | Go To |
| **Ctrl+1** | Format Cells |
| **Ctrl+T** | Make a table |
| **Ctrl+Shift+L** | Turn filters on or off |
| **Ctrl+D**, **Ctrl+R** | Fill down, fill right |
| **Ctrl+E** | Flash Fill |
| **Ctrl+;** | Enter today's date |
| **Ctrl+`** | Show formulas |
| **F2** | Edit the active cell |
| **F9** | Recalculate |
| **Shift+F11** | Insert a sheet |
| **Ctrl+Page Down**, **Ctrl+Page Up** | Next sheet, previous sheet |

To use the ribbon from the keyboard, press and release **Alt** (or press **F10**, which also works on a Mac), then type the letters that appear.
