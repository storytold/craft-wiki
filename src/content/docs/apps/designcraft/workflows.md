Shortcuts on this page use **Ctrl**. On a Mac, use **⌘** in place of **Ctrl**, and **Option** in place of **Alt**.

## Find your way around

DesignCraft's menus are **File**, **Edit**, **Layout**, **Type**, **Object**, **Table**, **View**, **Window** and **Help**. The Tools panel is on the left, and the panels are on the right.

- The **Properties** panel changes with what you select. For a text frame it shows its position and size, fill and stroke, columns and text wrap, with quick buttons such as **Group** and **Lock**.
- Every panel is in the **Window** menu. **Window › Workspace** switches between panel layouts such as **Essentials**, **Typography** and **Printing and Proofing**.
- **Edit › Quick Apply…** (**Ctrl+Return**) searches your styles and DesignCraft's commands. Type a few letters and press **Enter**.
- **Edit › Keyboard Shortcuts…** shows and changes every shortcut.

## Set up pages

- **Window › Pages** shows every page and spread. Use it to add, move and delete pages.
- **Layout › Pages › Insert Pages…** (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) adds pages.
- **Parent pages** hold what repeats, such as page numbers and running heads. Make one with **Layout › Pages › New Parent…**, and use it with **Layout › Pages › Apply Parent to Pages…**.
- **Layout › Margins and Columns…** changes the margins and columns of the pages you're on.
- **File › Document Setup…** (**Ctrl+Alt+P**) changes the page size, facing pages and bleed of the whole document.

To number pages, draw a text frame on a parent page and choose **Type › Insert Special Character › Markers › Current Page Number** (**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N**).

## Thread text from frame to frame

A long story can flow through several text frames, across columns and pages.

1. Select a text frame with the **Selection Tool** (**V**). Each text frame has a small in port at its top left and an out port at its bottom right. A red **+** in the out port means there's more text than fits.
2. Click the out port. The pointer becomes a loaded text cursor.
3. Click another frame to thread the text into it. Or click empty space to make a new frame the width of the column there, or drag to draw one.

Hold **Shift** as you click to flow the rest of the story onto the pages that follow, adding pages as needed. To see how frames link, choose **View › Extras › Show/Hide Text Threads** (**Ctrl+Alt+Y**).

## Wrap text around objects

Select a picture or shape, then pick a wrap in the **Text Wrap** section of the **Properties** panel, or in **Window › Text Wrap**. Set **Offset** to keep the text a little way off.

## Format with styles

Styles keep a document consistent: change a style once, and all the text using it updates.

- **Paragraph styles** (**Type › Paragraph Styles**, **Ctrl+F11**) set the font, size, spacing, indents, hyphenation and so on for whole paragraphs.
- **Character styles** (**Type › Character Styles**, **Ctrl+Shift+F11**) change words within a paragraph, such as a bold run-in or an italic title.
- **Type › Character** (**Ctrl+T**) and **Type › Paragraph** (**Ctrl+Alt+T**) format the selected text directly.
- **Type › Bulleted & Numbered Lists** adds bullets and numbering.

To edit long text without the layout getting in the way, choose **Edit › Edit in Story Editor** (**Ctrl+Y**). **Edit › Find/Change…** (**Ctrl+F**) finds and replaces text.

## Place pictures and other files

Choose **File › Place…** (**Ctrl+D**). It takes:

| Kind | File types |
| --- | --- |
| Pictures | PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, PSD, SVG |
| Vector artwork | PDF, AI, EPS |
| Text | TXT, DOCX, RTF, MD |
| Spreadsheet | XLSX, placed as a table |
| Video and sound | MP4, M4V, MOV, WebM, MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG |

If an empty or picture frame is selected, the file fills it. If not, click to place it at its own size, or drag to draw its frame. For a PDF with several pages, DesignCraft asks which page to place. An EPS shows its preview only.

To fit a picture to its frame, use **Object › Fitting**: **Fill Frame Proportionally**, **Fit Content Proportionally**, **Fit Frame to Content** and so on.

To map the styles in a Word or RTF file to your document's styles as it comes in, use **File › Place with Import Options…** (**Ctrl+Shift+D**).

## Work with color

**Window › Color › Swatches** lists the document's named colors. Add a swatch once, then use it everywhere, so a change to the swatch changes every object that uses it. Swatches can be RGB or CMYK colors, tints and gradients.

Before you send a job to print, check it on screen with **View › Overprint Preview** and **View › Separations Preview**.

## Add tables

Choose **Table › Insert Table…** (**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T**) with the text cursor in a frame. The **Table** menu then inserts and deletes rows and columns, merges and splits cells, and turns rows into header or footer rows. **Table › Convert Text to Table…** turns tabbed text into a table.

## Long documents

- **Type › Insert Footnote** adds a footnote at the cursor.
- **Layout › Table of Contents…** builds a table of contents from your paragraph styles. **Layout › Update Table of Contents** refreshes it.
- **Layout › Index** adds index entries and builds the index.
- **Window › Utilities › Book** gathers several documents into one book.
- **Window › Utilities › Data Merge** fills a layout from a spreadsheet or CSV file, for name badges, cards and the like.

## Check spelling

**Edit › Spelling › Check Spelling…** (**Ctrl+I**) goes through the document. Turn on **Edit › Spelling › Dynamic Spelling** to underline misspelled words as you type.

## Export a PDF

Choose **File › Export PDF…**, pick a **Preset:**, click **OK** and choose where to save.

| Preset | Use it for | Standard | Crop and bleed marks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Desktop Printing** | Your own printer | None | Off |
| **Commercial Printing** | A print shop | None | On |
| **Screen and Email** | A small file to send or show on screen | None | Off |
| **PDF/X-1a:2003** | A print shop that asks for PDF/X-1a | PDF/X-1a:2003 | On |
| **PDF/X-4** | A print shop that asks for PDF/X-4 | PDF/X-4 | On |
| **PDF/A-2b** | Archiving | PDF/A-2b | Off |

You can change any setting after picking a preset, which switches it to **Custom**:

- **General**: **Page Range:** (for example `1-3,5`) and **Spreads**.
- **Compression**: **Compress images**.
- **Marks and Bleeds**: **Include document bleed**, **Crop Marks**, **Bleed Marks** and **Page Information**.
- **Advanced**: the **Standard:** and **Tagged PDF**.

DesignCraft remembers your settings for next time.

- **Export Page as PNG…** (**Ctrl+E**)
