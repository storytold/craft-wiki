# Craft Wiki

Craft Wiki is the documentation site for ArtCraft Studio and the Craft Apps, published at [craft.wiki](https://craft.wiki). The site is generated as static HTML and edited in GitHub or through a self-hosted Sveltia CMS interface.

## How it fits together

1. Contributors edit Markdown files in this repository, either directly or through the visual editor.
2. Astro and Starlight turn those files into a static site in `dist/`. The build also bundles the Sveltia editor into the site.
3. A push to `main` runs a GitHub Actions workflow that calls a Cloudflare deploy hook.
4. Cloudflare Workers Builds checks out the repository, runs the build, and deploys the generated files as static assets. The Worker serves the public site and editor and handles Discord sign-in; it does not need a database.

The [Cloudflare hook workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) succeeding means Cloudflare accepted the hook request. Check the Worker's build history separately to confirm that the build and deployment succeeded.

`dist/`, `.astro/`, `node_modules/`, and `public/admin/vendor/` are generated and are not committed. The editor bundle is installed from the pinned npm dependency and copied into `public/admin/vendor/` by the build; the deployed editor does not depend on a CMS CDN.

## Local development and builds

Use Node.js 22.23.4 or newer and npm 9.6.5 or newer. The repository's `.nvmrc` selects Node 22; ensure the installed Node 22 release meets Astro's minimum version.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Astro prints the local development URL. To prepare the editor bundle before using `/admin/` locally, run `node scripts/prepare-cms.mjs` after installing dependencies, or run a production build first:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

`npm run build` copies the Sveltia bundle, then runs `astro build`. Starlight renders the content collection to `dist/`, builds a Pagefind search index, and emits a sitemap. `npm run preview` serves that generated output locally. The custom sidebar's search field filters app names; it is separate from the Pagefind index.

## Documentation content

App guides are Markdown files under `src/content/docs/apps/<app-slug>/`. Their paths determine their URLs. For example, `src/content/docs/apps/photocraft/getting-started.md` is published at `/apps/photocraft/getting-started/`.

Each app currently has five pages:

- `overview.md`
- `getting-started.md`
- `install-update.md`
- `workflows.md`
- `troubleshooting.md`

Pages start with YAML frontmatter for Starlight. The visual editor exposes the title, optional description, and Markdown body:

```markdown
---
title: Getting started
description: Getting started with PhotoCraft.
---

Write the guide here.
```

Use Markdown headings, links, lists, images, and code blocks for the content. Images uploaded through the editor are committed under `public/assets/uploads/` and served from `/assets/uploads/`. The existing app icons live under `public/assets/apps/`.

Starlight uses the `docsLoader()` and `docsSchema()` in `src/content.config.ts` to load and validate content. A malformed frontmatter field or unsupported schema value can fail the build. Check the Astro build output when adding metadata or MDX components.

### Adding or reorganizing an app

The navigation and home page have a small amount of explicit configuration. To add an app:

1. Create its Markdown pages under `src/content/docs/apps/<slug>/` and add its icon to `public/assets/apps/`.
2. Add its slug, display name, and any non-default icon extension to `src/data/apps.mjs`, and add an official app's slug to its category in `appCategories` there. `WikiSidebar.astro` uses these lists to render the icon and expandable group under its category; the build stops if an official app has no category.
3. Add a matching app group in `astro.config.mjs` and a collection in `public/admin/config.yml` so Starlight and Sveltia can find its pages.
4. Add an icon card to the same category in `src/content/docs/index.mdx` and update its app count.
5. Run `npm run build` and check the home page, app links, and `/admin/`.

The custom sidebar uses the `guides` list in `src/data/apps.mjs` for its links. If guide filenames or the set of guides change, update that list too. Pages an app has beyond the five shared guides, such as WordCraft's Zotero page, go in `extraGuides` under the app's slug; the sidebar lists them before Troubleshooting. Give them `sidebar.order` in their frontmatter too, so the previous and next links follow the same order. Pages that the sidebar nests under one guide, such as VectorCraft's task guides under Workflows, go in `childGuides` under the app's slug and then the guide's slug. The sidebar lists them under that guide's link and expands the list on the guide and on each of its pages. Give them `sidebar.order` values between the guide's and the next page's, so the previous and next links visit them right after the guide. Starlight's autogenerated sidebar configuration does not by itself add links to the custom sidebar.

## Visual editor

The header's **Edit wiki** link opens `/edit/`, which explains sign-in and links to `/admin/`. Sveltia CMS is a browser-based visual editor for the app collections in `public/admin/config.yml`. Choose an app, select a page, edit its title, description, and body, then save. The editor uses GitHub as its backend and the configured branch is `main`.

### Discord sign-in

Anyone with the **Senior Contributor** role in the ArtCraft Discord server can edit the wiki. In `/admin/` they choose **Sign In Using Discord**. They need no GitHub account or token.

The CMS hardcodes its sign-in labels and offers no option to rename them, so `scripts/prepare-cms.mjs` rewrites both in the generated bundle: the top button reads **Sign In Using Discord** and starts the Worker's Discord sign-in, and the lower one reads **Sign In Using GitHub Access Token**. The build fails if a bundle update drops either label.

[`worker/index.js`](worker/index.js) handles this:

1. `/api/auth` signs the person in with Discord and checks the role in `DISCORD_ROLE_ID`. It issues a signed session that lasts 8 hours, so someone who loses the role keeps access until it expires. Discord may finish in a new tab, for example after handing off to its desktop app, so the page then saves the session itself and opens `/admin/`.
2. `/api/github/` is the editor's GitHub API. Sessions use the Worker's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which never reaches the browser. They can read the repository and can commit only to `src/content/docs/apps/` and `public/assets/uploads/` on `main`. Each commit body names the Discord user, because the commit itself belongs to the token's GitHub account.
3. GitHub tokens from maintainers and contributors pass through this route unchanged and are not stored.

The Discord application is ArtCraft FredBot. Its OAuth2 settings need the redirect `https://craft.wiki/api/auth/callback`. The bot itself does not need to run. The IDs are in `wrangler.jsonc`, and these Worker secrets are set in Cloudflare, never in this repository:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | The application's OAuth2 client secret |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | A fine-grained token for `storytold/craft-wiki` with **Contents: Read and write** |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | A long random value. Changing it signs everyone out |

Until they are set, the button reports that sign-in is not configured and token sign-in keeps working. Run the Worker's tests with `node --test worker/index.test.mjs`.

### GitHub access and token

Maintainers with write access to `storytold/craft-wiki` can use a fine-grained personal access token:

1. In GitHub, create a fine-grained personal access token owned by the appropriate account or organization.
2. Under repository access, choose **Only select repositories** and select **`storytold/craft-wiki`**. No other repository is required.
3. Set repository permission **Contents** to **Read and write**. GitHub adds read-only Metadata access automatically. The organization may need to approve the token.
4. Open `/admin/`, choose **Sign In Using GitHub Access Token**, and provide the token in the editor. Do not commit tokens to the repository.

Community contributors without write access can use a classic personal access token with the `public_repo` scope for this public repository. This scope covers public repositories accessible to that GitHub account, including the contributor's fork; it cannot be restricted to `storytold/craft-wiki` alone. The editor prompts contributors to create or reuse a fork. See [Sveltia's open-authoring documentation](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/workflows/open) for current requirements.

Sveltia stores its sign-in token in the browser's local storage and reaches GitHub through the Worker's `/api/github/` route. See [Sveltia's GitHub backend documentation](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/backends/github) for current token and authentication details.

### Open authoring and review

Open authoring is enabled in the backend, with `editorial_workflow` as the top-level publish mode. The app collections opt into `simple` mode for maintainers, so people with write access still save directly to `main`. A protected branch can prevent direct saves for users who cannot push to it.

For contributors without write access, Sveltia creates or reuses their fork and saves each draft on a branch there. Saving a draft alone does not open a pull request: choose **Send for Review** or move the entry to **In Review** to create a PR against `main`. Maintainers review and merge that PR on GitHub; merging triggers the normal deployment. Contributors do not need write access to `storytold/craft-wiki`, and a draft does not go live until it is merged.

The public repository allows forks. If a contributor's fork has become stale and the CMS cannot synchronize workflow files, they can sync the fork on GitHub before trying again. The configuration deliberately does not request the broad `workflow` scope.

GitHub OAuth is not configured: the editor's top sign-in button goes to Discord through this Worker.

### What can be edited visually

The app guide collections under `src/content/docs/apps/` are available in Sveltia. The homepage's MDX layout, app cards, app list, and theme are maintained in the repository code rather than in the visual editor. `/admin/` is a content editor, not an inline page-layout editor.

## Layout and theme

The site uses Astro Starlight with custom components configured in `astro.config.mjs`:

- `WikiHeader.astro` renders the Craft Wiki brand, the search box and the navigation, including the edit link. Search covers every page's text, through the Pagefind index Starlight builds, and the page a result opens highlights the searched words.
- `WikiSidebar.astro` renders the searchable app list, each app's icon, and expandable guide links. The current app is expanded on its pages.
- `WikiPageTitle.astro` hides the default Starlight page title on the custom home page and retains it on guide pages. It also gives each app page a search-result title with the app's name, such as "CADCraft › Troubleshooting".
- `WikiThemeProvider.astro` starts in dark mode and restores the visitor's saved light or dark choice.

`src/styles/custom.css` styles the layout and uses the Archivo, Instrument Serif, Inter, and Geist Mono font families to match the main ArtCraft site. Font files are npm dependencies and are bundled during the build. The homepage markup and its hero copy live in `src/content/docs/index.mdx`.

## Cloudflare deployment

The current site uses **Cloudflare Workers static assets** with a small Worker for `/api/*`. `wrangler.jsonc` names the Worker `craft-wiki`, points its assets directory at `./dist`, and sets `worker/index.js` as its entry point. The Cloudflare build settings should use:

- **Production branch:** `main`
- **Root directory:** repository root (leave blank)
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Deploy command:** `npx wrangler deploy`
- **Preview command:** `npx wrangler preview`

The Worker name in Cloudflare must match the name in `wrangler.jsonc`. `craft.wiki` must be configured as a custom domain on the Worker in Cloudflare. The repository does not create or manage the Cloudflare account, domain, or Git connection.

For the current hook-based deployment, the repository Actions variable `CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOY_HOOK` contains the Cloudflare build hook URL. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` calls it on pushes to `main`; it can also be run using **Actions → Trigger Cloudflare deploy → Run workflow**. It needs no repository checkout or GitHub write permissions. If the hook changes, update the variable in **GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**.

If Cloudflare's own Git integration also triggers production builds on every push, the hook workflow can cause an additional build. Choose the trigger arrangement that matches the Cloudflare project settings.

### Troubleshooting deployments

- If the workflow fails immediately, check that `CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOY_HOOK` exists and that the hook is active.
- If the hook succeeds but the site is unchanged, inspect **Workers & Pages → craft-wiki → Deployments → View Build History**. Confirm the build used the intended `main` commit and completed successfully.
- If the old site remains visible, check the Worker/domain routing and the currently deployed version. The GitHub Actions result alone does not confirm which Cloudflare version is live.
- If `/admin/` fails to load, check that the build copied `public/admin/vendor/` and that `dist/admin/index.html`, `dist/admin/config.yml`, and the CMS bundle exist.
- If editor sign-in fails, check the token type and scope, and any organization approval. Maintainers need repository write access; contributors instead need permission to create a fork. If saving fails after a successful login, check branch protection, fork synchronization, and the build history.

## Safe Browsing status

Chrome's warning comes from Google's Safe Browsing verdict for `craft.wiki`, and a partial listing (status 3) only covers some pages, so the site can look fine while the sign-in URLs warn. `npm run check:safebrowsing` prints the verdict and exits non-zero when the site is listed; `.github/workflows/safebrowsing.yml` runs it daily and on demand from **Actions → Check Safe Browsing status**. When it fails, open **Security issues** in Search Console for the sample URLs and request a review there: the listing clears only after Google reviews it.
